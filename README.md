# COVID19 impact on homelessness in California
## Research Question: What was the impact of COVID-19 on the homeless populations in various counties of California, and what factors influenced these effects?
HYPOTHESIS:

1. Less affluent counties were more impacted by COVID-19 than more affluent counties, correlating with higher homelessness (heat map and regression)

2. Following the start of the data (4/14/20), Californiaâ€™s homeless population has increased but has since decreased to a level between where it started and its peak. 2019-2023 (line graph over time for California (bolded in some way), smaller line graphs for 6-7 other counties)

3. Counties that received higher COVID-19 relief funding per capita experienced a smaller rise in homelessness rates compared to those with lower relief funding.  2019-2020-2021-2022-2023 (dotplot percentage change in homelessness from 2020 to 2022 as y, relief as x, each dot is a county)
